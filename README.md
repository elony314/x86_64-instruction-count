# x86_64 Instruction Count

This project attempts to answer the question of how many `x86-64` instructions there are.  See [the corresponding blog post for more information](http://stefanheule.com/blog/how-many-x86-64-instructions-are-there-anyway/).

## Get All The Instructions:
./instr-count --mode "mnemonic_att" --show_instructions > mnemonic_att.txt
